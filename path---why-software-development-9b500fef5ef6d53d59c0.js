From the time we got our first family computer at home, I was hooked. Although during those days I was only interested in playing the next <em>Reader Rabbit</em> game or <em>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</em>, I soon began to explore all things computer, except programming. I was building computers for myself in middle school and in high school I was learning about networking in my CCNA courses.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few more years and it is time for college. I always wanted to major in computer engineering to fill my void of knowledge that I had in development. Well when I started college, and I took engineering physics and calculus in the same semester I quickly decided that maybe programming is not for me after all. I had completed a Python course by this time, but these math courses were really making me think twice about my major. So I gave up and ended up changing my major to Accounting.</p>\n<p>We just went through many years of my life in less than 5 minutes. I hope that was fun! So you may be wondering, "but Kris, if you decided not to be a programmer and changed your major, what are you doing writing this blog? I thought you would never ask!</p>\n<p>About a year ago, I started to play around with programming again. I could not decide which language I wanted to learn, but I was determined to learn something! I started doing lots of research on the age old question "which programming language should I learn first". After many, many hours spent on Codeacademy, and Team Treehouse, and Udacity, I soon started to realize that hey, I could actually learn to program. I don\'t need a strong calculus background for the web development courses I had been taking. </p>\n<p>I stumbled across Course Report, and I don\'t even remember how or where I found them, but it appeared to be a pretty good site for these "coding bootcamp" things I kept reading about online. After months of reading reviews and emailing deans of different schools, I finally pulled the trigger on my decision to apply for Flatiron Schools Learn Verified program, and the rest was history.</p>\n<p>I say all of this to say, I really enjoy software development. It is so rewarding to be able to type something into a text editor in a completely new language, and have it actually do something, create something. There is no other feeling like it.</p>\n<h2>Watch out world.

So I do not think that I would even attempt to explain different data structures to my mom. But for the sake of this blog post, I am going to give it a shot!</p>\n<p>Dear Mom,</p>\n<p>Today we are going to be discussing a specific data structure called a <code>Hash</code>. These used to be my worst nightmare when I first started at Learn-Verified, but I am slowly beginning to see just how awesome they are. A hash is built with <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code>. You can think of a hash like a job application. The job application will have some title, and then below that it will ask you to answer questions by filling in boxes. The questions on the application are the keys, and the answers are the values.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-CodeMaster Application-</p>\n<p>Name: Kris\nExperience: None</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amazing reproduction of a job application, I know, but you get the point. Now let\'s see that has a hash.</p>\n<p><code>codemaster_application = {:name => "Kris", :experience => "None"}</code></p>\n<p>A hash is really powerful because of the way that you can search for information within a hash. You can even make <code>values</code> in the hash another hash or array.</p>\n<p>Creating a hash is as simple as <code>hash = {}</code>. Once the hash is created, you can add key/value pairs like this: <code>hash[:key]="value"</code></p>\n<p>Sincerely,\nKris</p>',id:"/Users/kris/Development/my-blog/src/pages/2016-06-23-data-structures/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2016-06-23",path:"/data-structures",title:"Data Structures",excerpt:"Trying to explain anything technical to my mom is usually a wash.",tags:["code","learning","blog"]}},next:null}}}});
