It was actually pretty fun building this thing out, but it has some small hickups, well maybe big hickups...</p>\n<p>The original concept of my CLI gem was going to be a gem that could parse the dorba.org website to provide the current status of the local mountain bike trails, as well as providing the amount of volunteer hours on each trail. After playing around with Nokogiri for 4 hours, and sitting on Ask A Question, it turns out that I would have to change the idea. What we eventually found out was that the data that I was trying to scrape was hidden by default on the website, and it was only showing because of jquery bootstrap. The data was too deep for <code>Nokogiri</code> to parse. This was a bummer, because my gem was basically finished, and now I have to start over.</p>\n<p>The next day rolls around, and I started to try to think of new ideas for my gem. This time around, to prevent the same issues from happening, I used my old gem with pry to try and parse out information before committing to a project.</p>\n<p>I decided to make a gem that provides information about the new game released by Blizzard, Overwatch. I was super excited for the game to release, and it did today (left work early to play it :)) This was all I could think about, so I figured this would be an appropriate gem idea.</p>\n<p>The gem scrapes the overwatch wiki page for the list of the current character line up, as well as the current maps that are available. As new characters and maps are added to the wiki page, my gem will be abstract enough to scrape the new data.</p>\n<p>I am excited for my next set of final projects.</p>",id:"/Users/kris/Development/my-blog/src/pages/2016-06-07-cli-gem-final-project/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2016-06-07",path:"/cli-gem-final-project",title:"CLI Gem Final Project",excerpt:"So I finally got my CLI Gem project done for Learn Verified.",tags:["code","learning","blog"]}},{html:'<p>Trying to explain anything technical to my mom is usually a wash. So I do not think that I would even attempt to explain different data structures to my mom. But for the sake of this blog post, I am going to give it a shot!</p>\n<p>Dear Mom,</p>\n<p>Today we are going to be discussing a specific data structure called a <code>Hash</code>. These used to be my worst nightmare when I first started at Learn-Verified, but I am slowly beginning to see just how awesome they are. A hash is built with <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code>. You can think of a hash like a job application. The job application will have some title, and then below that it will ask you to answer questions by filling in boxes. The questions on the application are the keys, and the answers are the values.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-CodeMaster Application-</p>\n<p>Name: Kris\nExperience: None</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amazing reproduction of a job application, I know, but you get the point. Now let\'s see that has a hash.</p>\n<p><code>codemaster_application = {:name => "Kris", :experience => "None"}</code></p>\n<p>A hash is really powerful because of the way that you can search for information within a hash. You can even make <code>values</code> in the hash another hash or array.</p>\n<p>Creating a hash is as simple as <code>hash = {}</code>. Once the hash is created, you can add key/value pairs like this: <code>hash[:key]="value"</code></p>\n<p>Sincerely,\nKris</p>',id:"/Users/kris/Development/my-blog/src/pages/2016-06-23-data-structures/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2016-06-23",path:"/data-structures",title:"Data Structures",excerpt:"Trying to explain anything technical to my mom is usually a wash.",tags:["code","learning","blog"]}},{html:'<p>So the story kind of goes like this...(shortened as a courtesy). </p>\n<p>I am what my friends and family have always called a "computer nerd". From the time we got our first family computer at home, I was hooked. Although during those days I was only interested in playing the next <em>Reader Rabbit</em> game or <em>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</em>, I soon began to explore all things computer, except programming. I was building computers for myself in middle school and in high school I was learning about networking in my CCNA courses.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few more years and it is time for college. I always wanted to major in computer engineering to fill my void of knowledge that I had in development. Well when I started college, and I took engineering physics and calculus in the same semester I quickly decided that maybe programming is not for me after all. I had completed a Python course by this time, but these math courses were really making me think twice about my major. So I gave up and ended up changing my major to Accounting.</p>\n<p>We just went through many years of my life in less than 5 minutes. I hope that was fun! So you may be wondering, "but Kris, if you decided not to be a programmer and changed your major, what are you doing writing this blog? I thought you would never ask!</p>\n<p>About a year ago, I started to play around with programming again. I could not decide which language I wanted to learn, but I was determined to learn something! I started doing lots of research on the age old question "which programming language should I learn first". After many, many hours spent on Codeacademy, and Team Treehouse, and Udacity, I soon started to realize that hey, I could actually learn to program. I don\'t need a strong calculus background for the web development courses I had been taking. </p>\n<p>I stumbled across Course Report, and I don\'t even remember how or where I found them, but it appeared to be a pretty good site for these "coding bootcamp" things I kept reading about online. After months of reading reviews and emailing deans of different schools, I finally pulled the trigger on my decision to apply for Flatiron Schools Learn Verified program, and the rest was history.</p>\n<p>I say all of this to say, I really enjoy software development. It is so rewarding to be able to type something into a text editor in a completely new language, and have it actually do something, create something. There is no other feeling like it.</p>\n<h2>Watch out world.
